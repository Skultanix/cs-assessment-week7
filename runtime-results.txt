    After testing the two functions' runtimes while taking in various sized arrays as arguments it would seem that the doublerAppend function scales considerably better than the doublerInsert function. Initially, the doublerInsert was about 50% faster than the other function but as the array sizes increased to the mediumArray size, the doublerInsert function's runtime grew considerably faster. When processing the extraLargeArray, the doublerInsert function's runtime was nearly ten times that of the doublerAppend function. The reason for this is because the .unshift method necessarily has to read an existing array and then add the new values to the beginning of said array, where as the .push method simply tags on values to the end of an array, and doesn't have to take into account where current items in an array are currently indexed at to shift them in the index since no values are moving.
