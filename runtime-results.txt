Findings

    After testing the two functions' runtimes while taking in various sized arrays as arguments it would seem that the doublerAppend function scales considerably better than the doublerInsert function. Initially, the doublerInsert was about 50% faster than the other function but as the array sizes increased to the mediumArray size, the doublerInsert function's runtime grew considerably faster. When processing the extraLargeArray, the doublerInsert function's runtime was nearly ten times that of the doublerAppend function.
